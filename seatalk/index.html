        <p>This season has been a rollercoaster for the Seahawks who are sitting with a season record of 6 and 3.
            We have a couple of good wins under our belt like Detroit and Cleveland but we have lost games that we
            easily could've won. The Bengals game was one of the most frustrating game I've seen in some time. The 
            way that our defense stiffled the high powered Bengals offense was super impressive, they held them to 
            only 3 points in the second half. The only problem is that the Hawks were also held to 3 points in the 
            half. And that is what I believe the root of our problem is, the incosistency of the offense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's start with the running game. We have one of the best young running backs in the game, and yet we
            havn't been using that to our advantage every game. He should be up around 100 yards and combined with
            the hard running of Zach Charbonnet our run game should be elite. I believe that we get too caught up
            with our passing weapons that as soon as a run gets stuffed we resort to an air raid attack. We need to
            lean into Pete Carroll's identity and really establish the run game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there is the Geno problem. Last season was an amazing return for him but lately he has been slipping.
            The two problems that I see with his game right now are one: turnovers obviously and two: holding on to the 
            ball too long. The turnovers, especially in the red zone, have been killer. Our offense can drive the ball
            down the field relatively well but the redzone mistakes have been costly, taking crucial points off of the
            board. That is what killed us in the Bengals game. That's why we couldn't take advantage of our defenses'
            great play. The two interceptions were fatal. Almost all of Geno's sacks have come with him holding on to 
            the ball too long and trying to make plays. Our receivers are good enough to create space, so get the ball
            out of your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            When our offense takes a couple steps of improvement we truly will be title contenders and we can hang with
            the best in the league. Unless we go up against Lamar Jackson of course.
        </p>
