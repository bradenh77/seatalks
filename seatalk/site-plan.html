        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Here on the home page is where the main articles and news discussions will be at. This is the main draw
        of the site allowing fans to see news and opinions on the team. The Seattle Seahawks are a professional
        football team in the NFL, the favorite team in many pacific northwestern people's hearts. People love to talk 
        and hear about their favorite team and sometimes they do not have someone close to them to talk about it. 
        And people love getting their opinions validated so they come to see what the discussion on the team is like 
        and if it aligns with what they were thinking, and if it doesn't that's where the discussion begins. I will 
        need to keep up with it by writing articles and publishing opinions that I have. The home page will also contain 
        the links and navigation to the other pages on the website. The other pages will include a contact/about us page 
        and a roster and schedule page. You can find all that you need right here, this website will be a one stop shop 
        for everything Seahawks including news, opinions, roster, schedule that will be able to fill the 12s needs.

      <h3>Roster & Schedule</h3>
      <p>
        Are you curious aboout who is on the roster? Well we have a full list for you here, always updated and opinions on
        certain players or position groups included. But we do not only have the roster here, we have the schedule as well!
        We are able to update you on who the team is playing as well as our predictions for future games and thoughts on 
        games past. The roster is constantly changing with trades and free agent signings but we will keep up with it for
        you! We have a great team this year with a lot of young guys soaking everything up and a ton of veterans to hold
        down the fort and make sure the young guys are learning as much as they can. The schedule gets rigourous after the
        week 5 bye. We play all of the teams in the challenging NFC East and AFC North this year so we will have to put our
        all into survivng those teams. But of course our biggest rival this year lies within our own division... the San
        Francisco 49ers. They are a tough out this year, but winning the division is within our grasp. Let's Go Hawks!

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        This page acts as both a contact us and an about us page. You can find out what we are all about and in what ways you
        can get ahold of us. As of right now it is a one man show, my name is Braden! I've been a Seahawks fan since I was 10
        that season was Russell Wilson's first year where our season ended in the divisional round to the Atlanta Falcons.
        My father was born and raised in Seattle, he grew up going to SuperSonics games and watching the Hawks on TV.
        Once I came of age he passed that fandom onto me, and even though I lived in the Seattle area for a very brief time
        I am a Seattle sports fan. I have seen the ups and downs of the last 10 years of the Hawks including Super Bowls and 
        missing the playoffs. Although I have not been around for the early days, I am engrossed in the history of the NFL. 
        I am fascinated in learning about the old generation. Legends like Steve Largent and Shaun Alexander hold a special 
        place in my heart. I believe that I have opinions that others will relate with and I love talking Seahawks football
        with many different people.
